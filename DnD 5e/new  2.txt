Portals lore. Each portal requires an orb key active at each end to open. The keys are interchangeable at each portal that is the same color. They make a low vibrating hum while open.


Other party is from the fighters guild in Sparrow's Point. They don't know where they are right now. They were assigned a job to track down a merchant's nephew who has gone missing. They tracked him to a tailor in Sparrow's Point who apparently kidnapped him and pushed him through a portal in his basement. (They maimed him and took him to the guild hall) The found the orb on him and learned of its use and went through the portal. They searched the few rooms and came out on the other side of the Conflux room before all hell broke loose.
