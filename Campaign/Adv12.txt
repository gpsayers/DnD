The PCs fight their way into the underground tunnel and find a map and a note. They then wreck some of the supplies and leave the way that they came.

They also collapse the roof of the tunnel while they are leaving.

Outside they see that their horses have been stolen. The group then heads to FallCrest on the idea of Ajax to get some help.

On the way they camp and are ambushed by a group of undead zombies and hounds. They continue their walk and pass the scene of a battle right outside of a small ghost town. The go inside the ancient temple and root out the spider creature found there. Some of their dead horses are among this bunch.

Once they reach the town of FallCrest they each head in a different direction.

Ajax - Pays for info from the Nentir Inn proprieter (Elandil) to try and find Velen. He also pays to have someone follow Uthar and see where he goes. Then he tries to locate Velen on his own. Talks with a drunken Red Knife but doesn't get any info.
Loknal - visits the local herbalist about his symptoms and receives several packets of herbs meant to take care of his symptoms. They help for 1 hour after he takes it.
Uthar - Finds the local apothacary and attempts to have a poison made for him. He paid in advance.
