New players are members of fighters guild
	They have a commission from an anonymous benefactor to retrieve a valuable "doll" from the lizard shaman temple.




Fighters guild members seem to be gathering at the local guild from around the area.




The players have assasins sent after them.




The players are warned by the blackmoom that they just had a contract taken out on them. 
	- possibly warned after the attack has occured.
	



The master vintner is seen leaving the fighters guild.




There are a couple of new comissions that just came in:

	Retrieve a powerful relic from the deep tunnels.
	
	
	Kill a wyrmling that has been killing farm animals.
	
	
	Also, the protector wants them to check out the east road. It seems that his messengers who have travelled that way have gone missing....
