The Knife's Edge is going to full sail. They players can see the last couple of waterlogged men being hauled onto the deck and gesticulating wildly. 
A shiny reflective light can be seen from the highest deck of the ship. It sails off in a westerly direction.

Werewolves
	The players are face to face with 3 werewolves who have just changed into men. Each wears a ragged set of shirts and pants and are barefoot.
	Tim steps forward with a wry grin on his face. "Well, well, well. Look what we have here." The other two have questioning looks on their faces and remain on their haunches
	at ease but not relaxed. They snif in the air.
	
	Tim woke in that alley and didn't realize what had happened, at first. But the quick healing of his wound plus all of the clues from the previous months soon revealed the truth 
	to him. After hearing that Quiznot had sailed for this land he decided to follow. Once arriving in Brag Brandop he was contacted by "others"..... and here he is.
	
	The werewolves are preparing for a war. These cultists are but a finger of this force. They obey the mighty Red Dragon Carnifex. They are in this province to root them out and kill them.
	And also to "search for allies...."

	
Assassins will make a move to kill the party.




Derendal might like to place a bounty of the men who killed the Brownstone Ranch family.




Party still has the quest to get the audience with Lord Dragonsinger
