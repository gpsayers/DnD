An old fisherman (Seabrook) has spotted a block object out at sea. 
	It looks like a black diamond floating just above the waves. It does not bob and swell with the ocean which gives it an eerie look.
	It causes bad dreams among the camp folk.
	Black dungeon of the void.
		It appears in times of unrest and portends great upheaval.
		It contains an intersecton point of several of the outer planes. The dungeon appears when the intersection appears and moves with it.
		The dungeon will need to be cleansed before whatever it contains destroys it from inside.
